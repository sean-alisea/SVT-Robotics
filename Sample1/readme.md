To whom it may concern...

To test this endpoint, you have several options.

1. Run the unit test.  This is how you should build endpoints, and anything without a user interface.  It is called test-driven-development.  And you should always have tests for your code.
2. Run the project.  Then use an api tool like Postman, for example, to send data and get responses.

I do apologize that this is not building or finished, but I spent too much time and you should now have an idea of how I approach solution-building.
